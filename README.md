## 🍀 BYI
 - I am AFK 99% of the time and usually only talk to people I am already friends with or people that are in the species I am in
 - I don't have a cover/touch discomfort but I really hate when people cover me so please don't
 - I am pretty childish and make a LOT of toilet humour jokes
 - I swear a lot and often make sexual jokes
 - I do not let anyone other than my friends use my supporter perks. If you ask I will ignore you
 - I use 'guys', 'dude', 'bro' and 'girl' in a gender neutral way
 - I cannot understand extreme typing quirks, please provide a translation or I will not interact with you
 - I am spiritually fictionkin and have been for 5 years, if you insult my kins I will take it personally
 - I don't care what fandoms you are in as long as you do not support problematic people or characters (apart from like... DSMP and Okegom. Y'all can fuck off)
 - I use the hide button liberally, if you piss me off I will hide you, it's just how I roll
