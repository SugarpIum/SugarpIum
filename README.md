   ### It's me, Plum!
   
- I'm 18 years old
- I go by they/them + a bunch of neos, but my mains are bun/buns and rat/rats
- I'm mostly known as Sosu and I sit by the sign at docks
- I mainly play Ponytown to chat with my friends and join species

## ðŸ”” Ding Ding!
   ### What's some basic info about you?
 - I have a multitude of names I'm okay with. **_Vince_** or **any of my current aliases** are fine, but I understand if you can't call me anything since most of my names end up being taken by other people anyway.
 - It would be nice if you remember to call me anything other than they/them. He or She is good.
     - I don't use neos but I'm okay with it as long as the neos aren't based off of they/them pronouns.
 - I'm very childish in nature. Please excuse my immaturity, I'm trying to work on it.
 - I have an auditory processing disorder, so in the case of places that have voice chats, you may have to repeat yourself a few times if I ask.

I'm really not the best at creating bios since I'm not great at remembering my ever so changing self. T_T

### What do you enjoy?
 - I don't really have a current fandom interest. It's kind of all over the place and I'm trying to find something new. If you have suggestions, feel free.

- I like Nintendo games, `especially the MOTHER/Earthbound series`. I also like Transformice, Puyo Puyo, OMORI, Gantz, Genshin Impact, and a few unlisted series that I won't disclose since it's problematic to some.
   - MMOs are fucking epic please recommend me some that you think I'd like.
- I'm... kind of addicted to VRChat... I would rather be playing that over PT, where most of you come from.
     -  If you play it as well, let's play together. ^_^ Communication through VRC feels a bit better than being on PT.
### Is there anything I should avoid around you?
 - The general thing most people dislike. AKA any logical DNI criteria such as racism or homophobia.
 - **PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP SENDING HATE TO ME.** 
     - I have a really bad history of PT stalkers, I'm very hide-heavy because of this. Don't take it to heart if I hide you.
     - I'm tired of people attacking me just for liking Genshin. I know I'm subhuman, I've been told this countless times.
 - If you value the morals of fictional characters over real people's traumas... I don't want you anywhere near me.
     - I don't want to get into details but people are really extreme when it comes to this. It's understandable if one is doing something illegal but if they're doing something with fictional characters just to cope, please just let them do it if it helps them...
     - If you're a proshipper though, I'd rather not deal with your weird shit.
 - Don't harass people for being doubles of you. Just hide them.
     - There will always be multiple versions of you in a world of media. I had to learn this, so should you.
  - I'm uncomfortable with _unironic_ sexual topics.
     - Jokes are fine but it's weird to talk about that kind of stuff especially if you're a minor.
### Anything else you want to say?
- You guys should really try github for your bios, it's pretty swag.
