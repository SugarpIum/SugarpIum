## 🍀 BYI
 - I don't really have a current fandom interest. It's kind of all over the place and I'm trying to find something new. If you have suggestions, feel free.

- I like Nintendo games, `especially the MOTHER/Earthbound series`. I also like Transformice, Puyo Puyo, OMORI, Gantz, Genshin Impact, and a few unlisted series that I won't disclose since it's problematic to some.
   - MMOs are fucking epic please recommend me some that you think I'd like.
- I'm... kind of addicted to VRChat... I would rather be playing that over PT, where most of you come from.
     -  If you play it as well, let's play together. ^_^ Communication through VRC feels a bit better than being on PT.
### Is there anything I should avoid around you?
 - The general thing most people dislike. AKA any logical DNI criteria such as racism or homophobia.
 - **PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP SENDING HATE TO ME.** 
     - I have a really bad history of PT stalkers, I'm very hide-heavy because of this. Don't take it to heart if I hide you.
     - I'm tired of people attacking me just for liking Genshin. I know I'm subhuman, I've been told this countless times.
 - If you value the morals of fictional characters over real people's traumas... I don't want you anywhere near me.
     - I don't want to get into details but people are really extreme when it comes to this. It's understandable if one is doing something illegal but if they're doing something with fictional characters just to cope, please just let them do it if it helps them...
     - If you're a proshipper though, I'd rather not deal with your weird shit.
 - Don't harass people for being doubles of you. Just hide them.
     - There will always be multiple versions of you in a world of media. I had to learn this, so should you.
  - I'm uncomfortable with _unironic_ sexual topics.
     - Jokes are fine but it's weird to talk about that kind of stuff especially if you're a minor.
### Anything else you want to say?
- You guys should really try github for your bios, it's pretty swag.

## 🩹 DNI
- General DNI criteria
- If you're against neopronouns or xenogenders. I don't care
- Proshippers. You're weird
- You watch/enjoy IRL/real gore
- 12 years old or under
